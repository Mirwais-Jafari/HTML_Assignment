        <h2>What is inside</h2>
            This book is a comprehensive guide to the Java language, describing its <b><i> syntax,
            keywords, and fundamental programming principles</i></b>. Significant portions of the
            Java API library are also examined. The book is divided into four parts, each
            focusing on a different aspect of the Java programming environment.
            Part I presents an in-depth tutorial of the Java language. It begins with the
            basics, including such things as <b><i> data types, operators, control statements, and
            classes </i></b>. It then moves on to <b><i>inheritance, packages, interfaces, exception
            handling, and multithreading </i></b>. Next, it describes <b><i>annotations, enumerations,
            autoboxing, generics, and lambda expressions</i></b>. I/O is also introduced. The final
            chapter in Part I covers <b><i>modules</i></b>.
            Part II examines key aspects of <b><i>Java’s standard API library</i></b>. Topics include
            <b><i>strings, I/O, networking, the standard utilities, the Collections Framework, the
            AWT, event handling, imaging, concurrency (including the Fork/Join
            Framework), regular expressions, and the stream library </i></b>.
            Part III offers three chapters that introduce <b><i>Swing</i></b>.
            Part IV contains two chapters that show examples of Java in action. The first
            discusses <i><b>Java Beans</b></i>. The second presents an <i><b>introduction to servlets</b></i>.
