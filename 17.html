            Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections of a document. The < hr > tag
            creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks
            the line accordingly.
            The < hr /> element has a space between the characters hr and the forward slash. If you
            omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the horizontal line, while if you
            miss the forward slash character and just use < hr > it is not valid in XHTML.
