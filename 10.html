        <p>
            <font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Not all data storage structures are
                 used to store real-world data.</font>
            <font face="Verdana" size="5">Typically, real-world data is accessed more
                 or less directly by a program’s user.</font>
            <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Some data storage structures, however,
                 are not meant to be accessed by the user, but by the program itself.</font>
            <font face="WildWest" size="5">A programmer uses such structures as tools
                 to facilitate some other operation.</font>
            <font face="Tahoma" size="5">Stacks,queues, and priority queues are often
                 used in this way. We’ll see examples as we go along.</font>
